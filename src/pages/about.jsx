            I'm Raha, a passionate web developer with a love for crafting seamless and engaging user experiences.

            I specialize in designing and building user interfaces (UI) that are not only visually appealing but also highly functional. Currently, I work with React and Vue.js, leveraging these powerful frameworks to bring ideas to life. My journey in web development is fueled by a constant drive to learn, improve, and stay updated with the latest technologies.

            For me, coding is more than just writing lines of codeâ€”it's about combining creativity and logic to create something meaningful that can make people's lives easier or more delightful.

            When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me enjoying nature, diving into a good book, or exploring new creative challenges. My ultimate goal is to grow as a developer while contributing to the vibrant and ever-evolving world of the web.
